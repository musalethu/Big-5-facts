        <strong>
          1. NEARLY ALL WILD LIONS LIVE IN AFRICA, BUT ONE SMALL POPULATION
          EXISTS ELSEWHERE…
        </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Nearly all wild lions live in Africa, below the Sahara Desert, but one
        small population exists around Gir Forest National Park in western
        India. <br />
        Lions in west and central Africa are more closely related to these
        Asiatic lions in India, than to those found in southern and east Africa.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong> 2. THEY CAN WEIGH 30 STONE </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        On average, males weigh 190kg (almost 30 stone) and females weigh 126kg
        (almost 20 stone). <br />
        They need this weight and power behind them to hunt large prey and
        defend their pride.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong> 3. MALES’ MAGNIFICENT MANES TELL A STORY </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Male lions grow impressive manes the older they get. These manes grow up
        to 16cm long and are a sign of dominance. The older they get, the darker
        their manes go. <br />
        As well as attracting females, their manes may also protect their neck
        and head from injuries during fights.

        <strong> 4. LIONS ARE BIG EATERS </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Lions can eat up to 40kg of meat in a single meal - around a quarter of
        their body weight. <br />
        Their tongues have sharp-pointed rasps, called papillae, which are used
        to scrape meat off the bones.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong> 5. THERE AREN’T AS MANY LIONS AS YOU’D THINK </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Only 20,000 wild lions remain in Africa, which is half of what it was
        only 30 years ago. Some scientists predict that wild lions could face
        extinction by the year 2050 if trends continue and humans don't increase
        their efforts to protect these amazing and powerful animals. The main
        threats to lions are loss of territory, lion/human conflict, and trophy
        hunting. As a traveler, you can do your part by traveling to national
        parks and game reserves that put resources toward protecting Africa's
        lions.
