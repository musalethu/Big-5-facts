    <h1>RHINO</h1>
    <div id="content">
      <h2>
        <strong> 1. THERE ARE 5 SPECIES OF RHINO... </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Two African – black and white rhinos – and three Asian – greater
        one-horned, Sumatran and Javan rhinos. <br />
        Three of these (black, Sumatran and Javan) are listed as ‘critically
        endangered’ by IUCN – there are thought to be fewer than 70 Javan and
        100 Sumatran rhinos left in the wild, <br />
        meaning their populations are truly under threat of extinction.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong> 2. RHINOS ARE HUGE </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sumatran rhinos are the smallest, but they can still weigh 600kg (that’s
        almost 95 stone). <br />
        And white rhinos are the largest, weighing up to 3,500kg (over 550
        stone, or well over 3 tonnes!). <br />
        This is mighty impressive considering they mainly eat grass and leaves.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong>
          3.THEIR HORN IS MADE FROM THE SAME STUFF AS OUR FINGERNAILS
        </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Rhino horn is made up of keratin - the same protein which forms the
        basis of our hair and nails. <br />
        Javan and greater one-horned rhinos only have one horn, whereas all the
        other rhino species have two horns. <br />
        Their horns grow continuously during their lifetime – the white rhino's
        horn can grow 7cm every year – and the record length is 150cm long!

      <h2>
        <strong> 4. RHINOS HAVE POOR VISION </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Rhinos’ eyesight isn’t great – they’re unable to see a motionless person
        at a distance of 30m – they mainly rely on their strong sense of smell.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong> 5. RHINOS ARE UNDER THREAT </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Over 7,100 African rhinos have been killed by poaching in the last 10
        years – that’s around 2 every day. <br />
        Poaching gangs are becoming increasingly sophisticated. In some cases,
        using helicopters to track the rhinos, and once the animals are shot
        with guns or tranquilising darts, their horns are removed using
        chainsaws, and quickly airlifted away. <br />
        The whole operation can take as little as 10 minutes, and if the rhino
        isn't already dead, it will often bleed to death. <br />
        Ground rhino horn is used in traditional Asian medicine to ‘cure’ a
        range of ailments, from cancer to hangovers. And the horn is seen as a
        status symbol, particularly in Vietnam. <br />
        Habitat loss and fragmentation are an increasing threat to rhinos, as
        human populations and infrastructure grows, encroaching on rhino
        habitat.
