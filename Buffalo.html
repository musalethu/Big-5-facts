      <h2>
        <strong> 1. HABITAT </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        In general, buffaloes favor grassland, whether it be open, wooded or
        bushed. <br />
        They feed and travel most often during the early morning, evening and
        nighttime. <br />
        Buffalos spend the rest of their time lying in shade, similar to cows in
        a field, although they likely sleep for only about an hour per day.
        <br />
        They are never farther than nine miles from a water source, since they
        must drink every day.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong> 2) Buffalo Herd Life Offers Safety in Numbers </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Living as a herd offers many benefits, like sharing the best grazing
        areas and water holes, but it also offers safety in numbers. The lion is
        the natural predator of the buffalo. When the herd is under attack they
        will form a circle around the young, old or weak members and use their
        large, sharp and deadly horns to protect them and fight off the
        predator. This is usually very effective.
      </p>

        <strong> 3) African buffalo's speed </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Although not the fastest bovine at 35mph (56kph), African Buffalo can
        still outrun lions. However, predators can accelerate quicker making the
        buffalo easy to ambush.

        <strong> 4. BREEDING </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Males test for females in heat by sniffing their urine and genitals;
        fortunately, competition for their attention does not entail much fierce
        fighting. <br />
        Posturing and mock battles serve as substitutes for conflict, which
        helps to keep these large, powerful animals from injuring one another.
        <br />
        Courtship entails a temporary male-female bond, which ends shortly after
        mating.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong> 5. FEEDING HABITS </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Buffaloes are strictly grazers. Different species of grass and even
        their parts—leaves, stems and inflorescence—are selected on a basis of
        smell, taste and protein content. <br />
        The amount of protein within vegetation is related to its tenderness, so
        grazers can weed out the nutritious from the coarse by the amount of
        effort needed to pull the plant apart. Seasonal changes in grass
        availability and nutritional value dictate the local movements of
        buffalo in semi-arid areas. <br />
        During the rainy season, they will feed on open plains; in the dry
        season, they retreat to woodlands, hill slopes and river fringes.
