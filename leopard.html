    <h1>LEOPARD</h1>
    <div id="content">
      <h2>
        <strong>
          1. Most leopards are light coloured and have dark spots on their fur.
        </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        These spots are called “rosettes” because their shape is similar to that
        of a rose. <br />
        There are also black leopards, too, whose spots are hard to see because
        their fur is so dark.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong>
          2. Leopards are fast felines and can run at up to 58km/h!
        </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        They’re super springy, too, and can leap 6m forward through the air –
        that’s the length of three adults lying head to toe!
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong>
          3. Leopards are very solitary and spend most of their time alone.
        </strong>
      </h2>
      <img
        class="img-center"
        id="leopard"
        onmousemove="setNewLeopard()"
        onmouseout="setOldLeopard()"
        src="img/brownField.jpg"
      /><br />
      <p>
        They each have their own territory, and leave scratches on trees, <br />
        urine scent marks and poop to warn other leopards to stay away!br Males
        and females will cross territories, but only to mate.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong>
          4. Leopards are skilled climbers, and like to rest in the branches of
          trees during the day.
        </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        They are strong beasts, too, and can carry their heavy prey up into the
        trees so that pesky scavengers, such as hyenas, don’t steal their meal!
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong>
          5. Leopards communicate with each other through distinctive calls.
        </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        For instance, when a male wants to make another leopard aware of his
        presence, he’ll make a hoarse, raspy cough. <br />
        They also growl when angry and, like domestic cats, purr when happy and
        relaxed.
