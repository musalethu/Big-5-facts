        <strong> 1) THE ELAPHANTS SENSE OF SMELL </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Elephants tend to hear or smell things first and then train their sight,
        instead of using vision as their primary sensory input. They keep track
        of their family members and non-family members using just their sense of
        smell.

        <strong> 2. CALVES CAN STAND WITHIN 20 MINUTES OF BIRTH. </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Amazingly, elephant calves are able to stand within 20 minutes of being
        born and can walk within 1 hour. After two days, they can keep up with
        the herd. <br />
        This incredible survival technique means that herds of elephants can
        keep migrating to find food and water to thrive.

      <h2>
        <strong> 3. THEY’RE THE WORLD’S LARGEST LAND ANIMAL </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The African elephant is the world's largest land mammal – with males on
        average measuring up to 3m high and weighing up to 6 tonnes. <br />
        Males only reach their full size at 35-40 years - that’s well over half
        their lifespan as wild elephants can live for up to 60-70 years. <br />
        And it’s not just the adults – even calves are huge! At birth elephants
        can weigh 120kg - that’s almost 19 stone

        <strong> 4. AN ELEPHANT NEVER FORGETS </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The elephant's temporal lobe (the area of the brain associated with
        memory) is larger and denser than that of people - hence the saying
        'elephants never forget'.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <strong> 5. THEIR TRUNKS HAVE MAD SKILLS </strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Elephants have around 150,000 muscle units in their trunk. Their trunks
        are perhaps the most sensitive organ found in any mammal - Asian
        elephants have been seen to pick up a peanut, shell it, blow the shell
        out and eat the nut. <br />
        Elephants use their trunks to suck up water to drink – it can contain up
        to 8 litres of water. They also use their trunks as a snorkel when
        swimming.
